## Version: 0.1.2
### Changes
    ? Added technology for speed (and energy consumption) increases for big factories
- Gave big structures more health and resistances
- Adjust big assembly pipe and loader locations to be centered and loader locations to be more symmetrical
### Bugfixes
- Rotating buildings near big factories no longer removes loaders
- Added wsf prefix to entity prototype names to prevent conflicts
- Loaders are now indestructable again
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Version: 0.1.1
### Bugfixes
- High resolution Refinery now has corrected offsets so looks correct now in high resolution mode
- Reset the tech effects which makes sure previously unlocked recipes have their big versions unlocked
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Version: 0.1.0
### Changes
- Added Oil Refinery (rare)
- Setting recipes now automatically creates map tags with the item's icon (can be disabled)
- Big factories now spawn on the 2x2 grid to match blueprints that have rails
- Balanced power consumption to be about 4 times higher to be more in line with other entities
- Loaders now rotate with big factories (added always-on pipes to make this work)
- Loader's speed now matches the fastest loaders or belts possible in your current game
- Limited spawning to the main surface
- Change ratio of spawning to change over time. First two spawns are furnances, but then the game focuses on assemblers
      until eventually finding a balance similar to whats required for an equal amount of all of the science packs
- Big recipes unlocks are now hidden from the technology screen to avoid clutter
- Improved algorithm for minimum distance checking to be much more efficient, also changing setting affects current buildings
### Bugfixes
- Fixed issue where factories could spawn on the edge of a chunk
- Added more edge-case testing to avoid crashes from bad data from other mods
- Added additional logic to further avoid spawning over ores, rso is optional dependency now
- Created cleanup logic for indestructable loaders that can sometimes be created by errors or conflicts with other mods
- Loaders under factories no longer copied into blueprints,a,
- Better localization for mods so "Unknown Key" doesn't show up for item-groups or recipes
