Current Issues
- Move info_icon up?
- Refineries too rare?
- Adding 5 dim, means no basic oil recipe?

Notes from 0.17 preview list:
- energy_source = "void" - Make mod that completely removes power?
- no-inserter-pickup/no-inserter-dropoff for big machines?

Potential Improvements
- Create dummy recipe for tags to use
-experiment with number spawned to make sure it is consistent with old version
resource layer collisions?
- Transport belts instead of destroy/recreate?
- algorithm improvevements for distance and nth tick
- Deploy script - Update forums and mod portal with latest version
- Git tag hook - Run deploy script when git tag in format vX.X.X
- Test game with Multi-Force PvP games?
- Item-group hide from players
- Balancing: Crafting speed, power, pollution, recipe factor
- Balancing: Rarer as distance gets further? Multiple types of machines based on distance? Tech to enhance machines?
- Icons for item-group mod support
- Animation
    - Get rid of animation will let me use higher resolution since max rez is size of sprite sheet
    - Also would further increase UPS/FPS
- Destroy loaders based on list?


Suggestions from users and other random ideas that may or may not happen
- Create giant miners (with infinite ore patches)
- Add giant beacons that increase belt speed
- Split giant chemical plants from assembly machines
- Make them buildable with research
- Make crafting bonus research (To increase power consumption would have to make a number of prototypes for each possible power level)
- Make research that controls number of available loaders
- Make "destroyed" entities turn into a repairable structure
- Make structures only destroyable by cliff explosives
- Lock in some recipes for machines
- Create whitelist/blacklist for lua surfaces using LuaRemote for other mods to stop these on their mod
- Why doesn't iron pipes and a handful of other recipes get hidden when adding "recipe.hidden = true" to recipe creation?
