Current Issues:
Issues with skan-advanced-mining
custom speed modules
techs to add speed modules
Adjust pipe
test updating from .8 and 1.1
loaders remove speed modules? Do they still connect to furnace?


Notes from 0.17 preview list:
- energy_source = "void" - Make mod that completely removes power?
- no-inserter-pickup/no-inserter-dropoff for big machines? - Maybe not... if people want to use inserters bad enough, I say let them.

Awaiting factorio features:
- On_Recipe_Change event
- main_product property exposed (for better tag images)
- Hide Recipes from main character screen

Potential Improvements
- Migrate - Items (tags), recipes, item-groups, crafting categories?
- Foriegn object handling hidden at the end of loaders
- Shift recipe icon upwards
- algorithm improvevements nth tick (factoriossmo queue logic?)
- Deploy script - Update forums and mod portal with latest version
- Git tag hook - Run deploy script when git tag in format vX.X.X
- Test game with Multi-Force PvP games?
- Balancing: Crafting speed, power, pollution, recipe factor
- Balancing: Rarer as distance gets further? Multiple types of machines based on distance? Tech to enhance machines?
- Icons for item-group mod support? (Awaiting hide ability so this is pointless)
- Animation
    - Get rid of animation will let me use higher resolution since max rez is size of sprite sheet
    - Also would further increase UPS/FPS
- 5 loaders on top side, 5 on bottom of the right side of assemblers

Suggestions from users and other random ideas that may or may not happen
- Random selection of available recipes?
- Create giant miners (with infinite ore patches)
- Add giant beacons that increase belt speed
- Split giant chemical plants from assembly machines
- Make them buildable with research
- Make crafting bonus research (To increase power consumption would have to make a number of prototypes for each possible power level)
- Make research that controls number of available loaders
- Make "destroyed" entities turn into a repairable structure
- Make structures only destroyable by cliff explosives
- Lock in some recipes for machines
- Create whitelist/blacklist for lua surfaces using LuaRemote for other mods to stop these on their mod
- Why doesn't iron pipes and a handful of other recipes get hidden when adding "recipe.hidden = true" to recipe creation?
